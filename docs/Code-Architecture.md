Overview
========

This document is an index document for the application's code-level architecture.  Anything that's
general code-level architecture belongs here.  This differs from "code standards" because it is used
specifically for implementation details related to architecture.

There are 2 documents that cover the code-level architecture for front-end or backend code:
1.  [Front-end API framework](Code-Architecture-FE-API.md)
2.  [Back-end API code patterns](Code-Architecture-BE-API.md)
