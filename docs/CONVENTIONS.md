Overview
========

This is reserved for conventions used outside the code itself, for anything
related to naming standards see [Code Standards](/docs/Code-Standards.md)

Branch Naming
-------------

### Enhancements
`story/{number}/{task description}`

* `{number}` should be formatted with leading zeros to 6 places (e.g. 000123)
* `{task description}` should be formatted as lowercase letters with dashes
  instead of spaces

### Bugs
`issue/{number}/{task description}`

* same as enhancement format

### Tech
`tech/{number}/{task description}`

* same as enhancement format
* these are essentially stories with a technical flavor- e.g. "bulk up unit
  tests", "refactor xyz module", etc.

NOTE: To start with we'll use Github's built-in issues but the long term goal
would be to use "Atoll" itself to track stories + bugs. We'll essentially build
it to boostrap itself as early as possible in the development process.

UI/UX Design
------------

The UI/UX design principles are based on the concept of Atomic Design.
See [Code Standards](/docs/Code-Standards.md) for more info.

Icon Format
-----------

All icons in Atoll are SVG icons to ensure that they can scale well to handle
different resolutions.  The icons are turned into React components so that they
can easily be styled.
