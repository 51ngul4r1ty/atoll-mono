Overview
========

* Todo (aka "Not Started")
* Busy (aka "In Progress")
* Done (aka "Completed")
* Accepted
* Released

Not Started
===========

Backlog items that aren't being worked.  Note that there are sub-states that
apply to these items- they may still need to be fully defined.  In future a
"Ready" status may be introduced.

In Progress
===========

Items that are actively being worked.  Items could still be paused to work on
other items, but once they're started they will be in this state.

Completed
=========

The work on this item has been done- this includes QA testing.

Accepted
========

This item has been accepted by stakeholder representatives (typically Product
Owners or someone acting that role).

Released
========

Typically story work is released to a production environment, but there are
items that are for developers themselves, so "Released" can also mean that the
changes are simply merged into the codebase without actually being deployed.
Whenever a work item is available to the targeted role it should be marked
as released.
