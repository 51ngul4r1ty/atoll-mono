Branch Policies
---------------

* Repos should have `master` branch protected in the following ways:
  - "Require pull request reviews before merging"
    - "Required approving reviews" = 1
    - "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"
    - "Require review from Code Owners"
