Atoll VS Code Extension
=======================

Atoll is an agile project management app specifically geared to teams using Scrum.  It is an opinionated implementation
that makes it easy for teams to follow best practices.  Unlike many other tools like Rally, Jira, etc. it doesn't offer
a highly customizable system.  Instead, it aims to do high quality Scrum as well as possible and to guide your team in
the right direction by making it harder to do Scrum "wrong."  This extension makes it very convenient for you, as a
developer working primarily with source code, to use Atoll without leaving VS Code.  Scrum ceremonies, like "standup",
"refinement meetings", etc. will still need to be done using the app though.
